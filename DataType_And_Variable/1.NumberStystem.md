# Datatypes

- bit, bytes mean 8 bit

1, "Hello", false

Need to convert the data convinent to humans to data that is convinient to computers that is binary.

## Number System

```c++
int dec = 15;
int bin = 0b001101;
int octa = 017;
int hexa = 0x23;
```

Hexadecimal system makes it a little easier for humans to handle streams of data with 1's and 0's.
