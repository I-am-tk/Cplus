# Statements and Functions

## Statements

- It is a basic unit of computation in C++ program.
- Every program is a collection of statements.
- A statement **must end with a semicolon(;) in c++**

```c++
// Each line is a statement in C++;
int value = 0;
return 0;
```

## Function

- It is a block of statements. It is a reusable piece of code.

```c++
int main(){
  /*
    All statement is enclosed by curly braces. This is called function body
  */
  int value = 0;
  return value;
}
```

- Declaration of Function

returnType functionName(parameter1, parameter2 ){

}

- A function must be defined before it is used.

### Inline function

Don't need to jump in the memory and store the return address in the cpu.

```c++
inline funciton add(int a, int b){
  return a+b;
}
```
