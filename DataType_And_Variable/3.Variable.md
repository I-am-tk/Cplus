# Variable

It is a the named piece of memory that you use to store some specific value.

## Create a variable

```text
typename variable_name {initalizer_value}
```

### Naming Convention

- Name must start with [a-z_]
- It should not contain spaces.
- It can have number anywhere but at the begining.

## Waysof variable Initialization

- Braced Initialization
- Functional Initialization
- Assignment Initialization

```c++
// It may contain random garbage value
int val;
// Initializes count to 0;
int count {};

// Below, we are going to loose some data.
int roundVal = 2.7;
int val{2.7} // give warning
```

## Variable Declaration

```c++
int a;
```

## Variable Initialization

```c++
int a;
a = 9; //intialization
```

## Variable Assignment

Once initialized a variable can be assigned new value.

```c++
int a;
a = 9; //initialization

a = 10 // assignment
```
